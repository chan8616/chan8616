This repo provides the implementation of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.10549.pdf

We used Chicago crime dataset from: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2

We analyzed the distributions of the dataset and checked they follows poisson distribution.

Lambda values are directly found by data analysis instead of running algorithm 2 in the paper.
